I worked through this project over a significant period of time, I have revisited and started adding features. 



This ReadMe needs:

* Instructions for setting up environment variables and Mongodb database



Things I learned from this project include about:

* Async Await

* Mixins

* Pug Templating

* Express Routing

* MongoDb Aggregations

  

There is still a lot in the project I don't fully understanding including WebPack.
