# Another Review App

A project to learn NodeJS and have a little fun. Currently no live deployment



When run users can create stores, make comments and ratings among other features such as "hearting" a store.

I created this with significant input from Wes Bos's Learn Node course.

I worked through this project over a significant period of time, I have revisited and started adding features. 



##### This ReadMe needs:

* Instructions for setting up environment variables and Mongodb database



##### Things I learned from this project include about:

* Async Await

* Mixins

* Pug Templating

* Express Routing

* MongoDb Aggregations

  

There is still a lot in the project I don't fully understanding including WebPack.
